    "The Kernel trick is a method used in support vector machines for performing non-linear classfication it involves implcity mapping the input data into a higher kernel -dimensional space using a kernel function by doing so the svm  can effectively find a linear decsion boundary in this higher dimension space even if the orginal input space is not linearly seprable this allow SVM to handle complex decsion boundariesand nonlinear feature without explcity computing the transformation into the higer -dimensional space thus avoiding the computational overhead common kernel function include the polonmiyal."
